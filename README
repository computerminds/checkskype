Run this script on a local network with others also running this script: Skype will be restarted if it dies.

Installation (on Debian)
------------------------

You'll need to move the cm_checkskype script to /etc/init.d/cm_checkskype.

Then you'll want to start that script when starting skype:

You can set a program to run when Skype starts up by going to:

Skype -> Options -> Notifications -> Skype Login -> Advanced View -> Execute the following script

If you copied it to the location as above, enter:

/etc/init.d/cm_checkskype start

This wrapping script checks if cm_checkskype.py is already running: which is important since it will be run again when Skype restarts.

For some reason you can't just start up the script once at system startup: if started too early it never finds Skype.
